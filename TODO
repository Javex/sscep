TODO list for SSCEP
===================

o Automatic verify for CA/RA cert bundle (write_ca_re(), fileutils.c)
	* Identify self-signed cert and verify against it

o Automatic verify for issued certificate

o Add meaningful exit status instead of SCEP_PKISTATUS_ERROR in some places

o Fetch CRL via CA cert HTTP distribution point (not really a SCEP thing,
  but nice feature anyway..)

o Write Unit Tests

o Fix handle_serial in sceputils.c to avoid guessing (adjust program afterwards)

o Better error strings: Use the GNU format or similar to display better error messages
